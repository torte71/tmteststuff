Wifi signal quality can be improved by switching to a better antenna.

The antenna uses a standard `U.FL` / `I-PEX MHF I` connector (that is NOT `IPEX4` / `MHF4`).
I am using [this antenna](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CG3F3FLN?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title).

There is a nice replacement case for the KlipperScreen, which offers a hole for an external antenna by GergoPrint3d: <https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/sovol-klipper-screen-cooling-fan-case-sv07-sv07-sv06-sv06-plus>

(Another big advantage of that replacement case is that it allows mounting a cooling fan for the KlipperScreen. The original design only uses passive cooling, the CPU easily reaches 60°C, which is far too high. With a fan, it stays between safe 40°C-45°C.)
