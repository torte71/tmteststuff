# Custom firmware options

## "Barebone" Armbian images

Armbian provides regularly updated image files for the MKS-Klipad50.

These images come with a minimal software setup, there are no Klipper components installed.

See [Armbian images](armbian_images.html#download-options) for a description of the different types and download locations.

## Klipper setup guide

You can follow my [rebuilding guide](rebuilding.html), a step-by-step instruction to install Klipper and Makerbase/Sovol additions using the barebone Armbian images.

## Ready "Klipperized" images

A readily prepared image that mimicks the original Sovol image is available on this [page](image.html).

You can also use one of the previous images from the [custom firmware archive](firmware_custom_archive.html).

These old images can be [upgraded](upgrading_mkspi.html) to use the current kernels, the resulting image will be almost identical to the recent ones.
